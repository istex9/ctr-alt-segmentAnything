#### Project description:

- https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/overview
- "Shipping traffic is growing fast. More ships increase the chances of infractions at sea like environmentally devastating ship accidents, piracy, illegal fishing, drug trafficking, and illegal cargo movement. This has compelled many organizations, from environmental protection agencies to insurance companies and national government authorities, to have a closer watch over the open seas."
- Our goal is to develop a deep learning model that can effectively segment ships in satellite images, accurately identifying their boundaries and locations (if there are any on the image).

#### File hierarchy description:
- test_v2 / train_v2: folders containing the images for testing and training
- train_ship_segmentations_v2.csv: csv file containing the image ids and the corresponding ship segmentation masks
- README.md: this file
- ship_detection.ipynb: the main notebook containing the code (from data exploration to model training and evaluation)
